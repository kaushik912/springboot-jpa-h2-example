Additional Notes:
I did everything in VSCode.

Extensions used:

- Java Extension for maven clean installs, etc.
- Spring Boot initializer extension to create new spring boot apps and add/update dependencies. This was a major time saver!! Highly recommended.
- Rainbow extension to color workspace ( this is optional!)
- postman extension to call requests
